This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling and loose comparison.  The `if` condition `if ($user_input == 0)` will evaluate to true not only when `$user_input` is the integer 0, but also when it's the string "0". This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're expecting only numeric comparisons.

```php
<?php
$user_input = ""; // or "0"

if ($user_input == 0) {
    echo "User input is zero.";
} else {
    echo "User input is not zero.";
}
?>
```
